# LinkFree

## Introduction

Hello and welcome everyone to another video, today we are going to be checking out a free and open source project called LinkFree created by Eddie Jaoude and their Open Source community EddieHub.


## What is LinkFree?

```
LinkFree is the Open Source alternative to LinkTree. A platform where people in tech can have a single hub to showcase their content in order to accelerate their career, whilst contributing to an Open Source project and being part of a community that has a say in where the project is going.

Your profile will have links to your social media and content. You can also add your timeline, testimonials, and upcoming events that you are participating in.
```

According to the LinkFree GitHub repo.

In short, it's a platform to host all of your links, with additional features, like Timelines, Testomonials and upcoming events.
